            "Hey guys, before this episode begins. I just wanted to let you know to check out the show notes for the link to Cindy markinson knees Nomad you and I podcast because she just posted her first episode. So I presume that she's going to be keep posting that on Soundcloud to the link is in the description. I think it'll be really cool to follow along and follow their story. So enjoy this episode is really cool. I think it's a good episode. I think you guys will enjoy it. So have  fun  Hello and welcome back to another episode of Jabberwocky. I'm joined here today by my co-host. Hello, David. I'm officially a co-host you're actually a co-host as of last episode. So congratulations a year of hard work and it paid off. Thanks. You're not getting paid, but it paid off we today.  Are joined by two very cool people Mark and Cindy Dunnigan. Hello. Hello. Hello. Great to be with you. Thank you for being on the podcast. I'm excited for this episode. This is it's been a long time coming mark is always ask me for very long time. When can I be on the podcast today is the day today is the day. I'm excited. I'm sorry. How do you guys feel I'm kind of scared kind of scary. Nothing to be scared of so to all the listeners right now. You need to say  Wherever you're listening to say Cindy you're doing a great job. They're all saying it right now. Thank you listeners. Cindy feels way better. So maybe here's what some backdrop is like because half of our listeners probably are people from Kentucky. Mostly just people that were friends way. This is true who have no frame of reference for who you are. So give us a little bit of backstory on who you guys are. I didn't even think about that. That is true. Well the back story is that we just celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary. So 40  Years ago in 1979. This is Mark and Mark was live with a a fast life and Mark works at a grocery store and Cindy shows up doing a promotion for the store. She's going to only be there one weekend out of her entire life. And so Mark goes up there and says hey, where do you live? And I'm going to come and see you tonight. And so we met we had nothing in common. Mark was going to get on his motorcycle. Dye his hair like Rod Stewart go across United States and slippery.  Stars and Cindy was going to go off to some little bible college in Florida that I never heard about and they're a preacher but something in me told me to ask her out again. So the next day was a Sunday. She went the services in the afternoon. We went on a motorcycle ride talked for hours. I want the services with her Sunday night. She pulled out her material on Florida college, and she was starting her senior year of high school and by Monday night. We were getting married.  No proposal. Nothing just it was understood. I was baptized a month later. We were married December 21st 1979 during Christmas break. She was still in high school. I started preaching on the weekends. I got my first preaching job and 1986 and Forest Grove, Oregon then we came to Beaverton 1992 and we just told the church in Beaverton. Just December 9th at sending myself are leave it in 2020. We have a sprinter van that were recording in right now.  Yep, we're going to go across United States for two years on the road and see at least a hundred churches. Wow. That was a lot. Yeah, it was crazy. That was yeah the female version of that takes about three and a half hours. I feel like I knew most of that but I was I'm still I'm still very intrigued by that story just the way it all worked out very fascinating. It's a podcasting and of it. Yeah, so that kind of segues into so this podcast is one.  We wanted to have you guys on the podcast but you guys are also starting a podcast to Chronicle your journey, which is called Nomads you and I Nomads you and I okay when it's a nomad Quest. No adequate. Yeah. Okay. That's the official title away strip. Are you have you named your perspective podcast yet for the podcast is called Nomads you and I yes, okay, and they journey is called The Nomad it's the Nomad Quest and you're sitting in the Airstream. You're not sitting on an RV say are we don't own an RV your  Sitting in an Airstream. So let's spend we're this. We're up there not specifically people specifically their extreme people because we're talking to Dad and Dad said, it's not an Airstream. It's a Winnebago. I pulled up to date fully expecting a Winnebago. I will though I was pleasantly surprised when it wasn't are street. So he showed me like what he was describing was is essentially like  Though whatever Winnebago version of this and mom was like I think it's a Mercedes and like so we pulled up today and this is a Mercedes. It's got the Mercedes logo on the front and it says on the side in all caps Airstream. Yep, so Dad just so we're clear. This is an Airstream an Airstream. Not a Winnebago. I have a theory about how this misunderstanding happens. So we've been looking and shopping for these openly for well five years. I don't know openly maybe for the last year or so and  Yeah Silas is also here. Okay, we basically quote-unquote married all the different versions of this so there was a while and I probably there was a while where is like, we're going to be in an a we're getting an a it's going to be an A and then mentally and then we'd realized something like for example, six miles to the gallon we cannot stomach that. That's just yeah, so and so probably at some point we  Have a Winnebago stage and I bet I walked up to your dad and told him something about a Winnebago. So yeah, but it is Mike. There is a nice as a comedian that I like who talks about camping and he says whenever he says when he goes camping and sees a Winnebago thinks. Oh, yeah, that's what I forgot. That's what I forgot my house. So I'm kind of glad you guys aren't in a way Tobago and this is very classy Vans very cool better than a Winnebago. So I think this is a good choice Mark was nervous about the Winnebago. Is this where the  Lawsuit comes in for defamation of whatever but yeah, every time we went into one the screens were after it was really like it was having issues plastic was popping off and so Mark sat down and said Toyota has been good to us. What is the Toyota of the our RV industry? And I said, it's their string. Hmm and that then from there my decision was made. Okay. So this podcast is one a podcast with you guys. But also this is a chance for you guys to kind of test out.  Asking in the air stream to see how it will be Q test out the user experience. Yeah, so but give us a little bit of like you can't talk about a little bit like overview of The Nomad Quest. What is it where you guys going where you guys going to do? What is kind of the origin of The Nomad Quest the Olmec The Nomad Quest? I think the origin is very old because basically it probably goes back to that initial. I'm not get on my motorcycle and drive across United States enslavement of the Stars.  So I think it really goes back to that. I think there's always been something in me that has long for a road trip on one hand United States of America was built for a road trip. You got the same language same currency, no borders and you got two oceans across the continent. It was just built for a road trip and then  along with that  the I guess it should get older to keep your brain Young on this trip. I probably will tell Cindy so many times. I'm on a road. I've never been on before and I have no idea what's around the next corner and there's something amazingly thrilling about seeing places for the very first time in your life that lights up everything in your brain. And then the other thing is I think I just want to see what's out there particularly how our church is doing across the country.  Tree. We want to try to hit a hundred churches how we're Christians doing. I've been in Oregon most of my life preached or most of my life and Oregon somewhat isolated from the rest of the country in that sense. And they're just a lot of people that we've known that are somewhere else now, but there's a lot of people that I only know by name recognition and I finally want to meet them face to face. So on one hand, it's all about people people are the most interesting thing on the planet. Yeah.  I think it's interesting that it's that you guys aren't like slowing down because you are retiring we're not using that word either. So we're not using the are what are we calling it? We're calling. I'm not sure what we're we're calling it The Nomad question, but I think yeah, I think it's interesting that you guys are like, we're now going to become members of a country club and we're just gonna go golfing every weekend, but you're actively putting yourself through this challenge. Like I can only imagine how much work.  Has been I mean the folders here. Yeah, and it's pretty thick. It's pretty thick. So Leslie Knope binder. Yeah. It's pretty big bigger than I thought a lot of research put was put into it. But I like how you guys are challenging yourself to keep thinking and to stay young and David Justice is breaking the interior design of this Airstream. So I think you know a lot of times it's part of its a Reload because I got a lot of commentaries that are not online. So in the next two years every I'm gone.  Try to get up online everything I've ever put together. We're also going through and redoing some of the stuff like the premarital counseling were condensing it like six lessons and really make it good. So it's almost kind of like a Reload re-energize retool and at the end of this two years just coming out already to I think we're going to be on the ground running anyway, but it's somewhat kind of like a reorganizational period to of  Like okay, you've spent 30 some years preaching is everything where it needs to be. Yeah.  Yeah, he has a collection of 1,200 sermons online and you know, and I have lots and lots of materials that I've written and I think it's just human nature that when you've been exposed to the same voice for say 28 years, which is about how long we've been at Beaverton. I think it's human nature that our brains tend to kind of rest and they kind of I think a new voice that was another reason why we thought the quest is that a new voice for the car.  Nation that we love the best, you know that maybe be fresh for them and the people hearing what we have to say for the first time. Yeah, you know, I think their brains light up because it's a new voice and a new way of saying ancient truths in a you know, fresh way. So yeah beneficial to everyone I think yeah, that's really cool. So you guys like you guys have a route router route.  It's Route 66, but I feel like I would say route you guys have a route planned out or like do you know where you're going? We do have a plan Cindy went through and investigated like where it is 70 degrees at any point in the country. So some of its could be chasing 70 degrees interesting summative is also based on at what time we leave because we've given that congregation here a little bit of options about after we sell the house.  We can either go right away. Or I can be around a little bit longer if we leave earlier. The route would be a Southern route down to California, Arizona the Southwest Etc. If we leave later, it will be a northern route of the Washington across the North Cascades Mount Rushmore upper Upper Peninsula, and we will drop down and then we would see like Ashley our daughter who's in the Boston area like September in New England and then down the coast of  Florida in the winter so some of its going to be like that but also there's kind of like we don't want to be too locked in we want to have some flexibility because we may hit a place. You've probably been like this. You'll visit a congregation and you're the last one locking up everyone kind of leaves and it's like well, there's nothing much here as far as you stood around waiting around for people, but everyone seemed pretty busy and then there's other congregation should go to  For Sunday, there, you make a lifelong friend and you could easily spend their two weeks. Yeah and that area. So we're trying to remain flexible in things like that. Yeah. So whether was the first thing we took into consideration, but then beyond that we want to try to hit as many sacred selection auctions this we can for fundraising for a cause that we you know, believe in adoption of children. So there are things like that that will play in originally we thought oh, we're going to need to make  all of our we want to hit all the national parks that are not in Alaska. Sorry, Alaska, but you're well, and at first we were like, okay, we got to have this routes because we want to for sure be able to get into Yellowstone and the more competitive national parks, but then we started realizing that's that there's actually other Parks just outside these national parks that you can still Park outright or friends even and so we realize now that's going to be too confusing.  Meaning what if we go to a congregation, that's like hey, we have a certain need and if you could be with us for a couple of weeks and you know, help us with whatever the situation is, you know, we can linger and so we won't have to cancel other things. And so we're going to try to have some kind of a sweet spot of in between, you know a plan but also a plan that really allows for a lot of flexibility. There's also things that guess for people listening to the podcast obviously, there's festivals, you know,  there's food festivals wanders the Garlic Festival and Gil are Gilroy California or things like that, but we're hoping also people because like what we do here Honeyman every year that we've done for 20 years. I know things like this are happening in other places. And so we really would hope that people would allow us to crash there either the family reunions or what are the what are the things they do at the congregation are a camping event. Yeah, the big camping were just saying hey,  We're in just let us know where it is. And where the show up, but that's something I hope we get a number of invites to of those sort of things. Okay. So if you have a family reunions out there let us know and we'll pass on the message or if you're playing a big camping large camping trips. Maybe the whole festivals food related activities with a large group of people. Let us know and we'll pass that on. So are there any like specific sites that you guys are looking forward to seeing?  Seeing you know that there is just so much out there that I even don't know about. I mean a national parks sound cool and High Sierras or Yosemite is and all the stuff that's in our in Utah. But at the same time it's interesting. I don't have a whole lot on my bucket list, but when we were in Hawaii recently, we drove by the there was a polo club and for some reason now I'm into I would love to see a actual pole.  Match somewhere and so yeah, that's I have thrown that on my bucket list. If you're into Polo let us know and we'll pass that on and this is not water polo. This is like horses horse Polo. Yeah water polo get out that allowed not allowed everyone see that. We're in a polo now well and kind of the quirkier the better for us, we're kind of not as much mainstream like we're probably not going to Disneyland or I mean, I'm  Using parts and such we we want to go to the places that Inspire Disneyland. So Thunder Mountain maybe not Thunder Mountain but more like Sedona Rice Canyon. Yeah, you know like show us the real thing. Yeah. We like Adventure things actually in this thick notebook to my right here. There is a long list of in the category of extreme adventuring. Okay. I mean, maybe 40 things. I don't know then there's like  Medium a venture like kind of like adventuring but wouldn't be called like extreme. So we want to experience it all what's an example of an extreme Adventure. Wow, what are these things called that it's this huge almost like a clear beach ball. That's bigger than a human being that someone pushes you around. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Are you rolling or are you with other people you are rolling? Okay. I know what you're talking about. I don't know what  R called but that's an extreme Adventure. Where do you think you're going to find that? Well, that's the other thing it when I want to go horseback riding by wanna go horseback riding in Kentucky. Like I feel like you should try to do the thing where the thing like be do New Year's Eve at Times Square and okay be at Thanksgiving maybe be where the pilgrims were or you know, I'm saying like yeah at the right time at the end. So also in these Adventures, where's the best place to white water raft?  Grand Canyon or you know, it's so kind of try to customize. What is this area specialized? Okay. Oh, yeah interesting. This is some good ideas for traveling. So when we come and see people I keep telling people like don't tell me what I can get anywhere else as I want you to tell me like what do you got here that you can't get anywhere else things like food. Mmm. So would you say that you guys are less interested in these big touristy areas in more interested.  In the things that you'll be like driving down the highway and you see a sign for the world's largest ball of lint. Oh, I love stuff I would say lint I feel like linse probably harder to accumulate.  Anyway, yeah, depending on where it's coming from. I don't know if you can compare those because where is this place where you can stand out? Is it over the Grand Canyon where you're standing on glass and you're looking down. I mean so some things. Yeah, the reason why it's so popular is the others reason for it it you know, it's just so fantastic and then there's these other yeah weird quirky things and I think I bought these three books called. I want to say weird America or something like that and it's only like there were three  Volumes, okay weirdest stuff, you can find all the other country cool. So it's probably a combination like good example would be San Antonio. A lot of people do the Riverwalk and the River Walk is absolutely cool. But in San Antonio you also have the Snake Farm and you have the toilet seat Museum. Okay, so we're kind of like you got to weigh your options there really Museum Riverwalk Snake Farm. So sometimes the sometimes the crowd is right on something like the river.  But sometimes off the Beaten Track you find and I particularly Cindy I think when we her why abandoned buildings in me abandoned buildings, it was towns. Okay for ghost towns.  I have a caveat caveat caveat about that. I was on a road trip once and I was promised that ghost town and we rode for an hour on this gravel path to arrive at this ghost town, but it was a fully functioning down our so many people there. It was crazy. I don't know what was going on. But there are so many people there even though it was branded as it goes down. So  They were never considered that but I think I'm fairly certain that ghosts can't ride ATVs if if I if my knowledge of ghost is correct. Yeah, I don't think they could ride ATVs. All right next question. Hmm. All right, let's see. It's mostly people that you guys like seriously if we had to if we were given the choice of do you want to go see cool stuff or do you want to meet Fascinating People? Hmm?  Fascinating People, I mean that's our favorite thing ever. They can be strangers. They can be brethren in Christ. They come in all ages all yeah, just Fascinating People so often when we get together with people we probably are going to be asking them. Who's the most fascinating person. You know, who should we meet next? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's what more could be as we travel across like a at this car.  Gatien, who should we talk to or you know get together we learn something from yeah because it really is Cindy's right. I mean we have and it's the real deal. A lot of times. It comes sitcoms and TV shows would have a character and what you realize is that they've modeled that after somebody in real life because we were recently at the beach eating and there was a family there from Long Island. And this lady said my chicken cutlets did it die for I'm gonna Kuno  like that who in Oregon even Cooks a chicken cutlet and then the relative that let me know that he was listening to me because I'd say something he'd say. Yeah, I got you. I got you and it's like when we are on Molokai the first day we were there and had the we had our little dumpy free rental car and had to change the tire on it. The man that changed it at the little gas station in town was at absolutely fascinating to listen to with all his Hawaiian lingo.  About where the grinds were in this and that I just it was like it was better than a movie watching him do what he did got an Excursion for them, but I'm not going to tell them what it is yet there. You've been waiting Excursion for the yeah. All right. We'll talk. Okay ducky Excursion with the F. Does it involved a cave?  Yes, now it does. No it does so excited. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about so you're you're moving into this Airstream. Are you guys getting rid of your stuff? You just put it in storage? What's the plan? Well, we have a we have a little place at the beach at thousand square feet two hours away. And so whatever want to keep is going to go there and then I assume that we're going to put stuff on the Air Stream and then after a few months or so.  We're going to look at what we got and either say it's just right or this is ridiculous. We pack way too much. We packed way too little and we will just adjust that. So and it's a very liberal. It's a liberating experience getting rid of our stuff. Maybe it's because we've done so much estate sale in the garage sale and we've seen people as they get older not take care of that not deal with their stuff and their old now, they don't have the health and there.  Stuff is now an anchor around their neck. And so I guess David I have I could get rid of everything. I have material thing. I have really no real sentimental attachment for much of anything I have and I really I really look forward to it's a lightning feeling just like hey, what are we really going to keep what do we really want? And then just sell the rest or give it away or Goodwill it or whatever.  Kind of an emancipation in a way. I mean, it feels sort of to me like losing weight. Yeah. It's kind of like losing weight, but it's also the realization that  I take we go to we went to some beautiful houses in Lake Oswego right on the lake for state sales. And guess what? You don't even get to take your use toothbrush with you when you die and so it's kind of like a preliminary lightening the load. Yeah. Yeah, we're kind of doing what people often do maybe in their late 80s sometimes or like right before assisted Care Living. I mean, we're just sort of getting a jump on that now in a way so we've always lived kind of lean. I mean this house that we're selling  Probably in March is only 1400 some odds going to be so and neither of us like a ton of clutter. So we've always pretty much like what we had and got every every year we'd have a garage sale and unload what we want what we were done with so we've always kind of done this and so now yeah, it's it's really great to hold every single thing you own in your hand and like make a decision right there, you know.  How much do I really want to keep this? And yes, it feels lean I can't explain it. I think and it's I think there was a little bit of that on our 40th one anniversaries because the good friends who went with John and Leigh Ann that you should interview John and Leigh and sometimes I do they insisted on or they said they were going to take carry-on only and we're gonna be gone 70 days carry-on only and guess what even in a carry-on only I could have taken fewer clothes and there's something really liberating about realizing, you know,  We probably only leave it need about two frying pans and a couple of pots a couple of plates couple of coffee cups, and not only that but the older I get boy anything I buy it has to make the cut. It has to have a useful purpose. I'm not in the not in the heaven stuff just to look at it and I'm not a collector. Yeah, and so what has to pull its own weight?  I need things to look at. Yeah, I know that comes as a shock to you. I see you go through my house and see the right. So yeah so visual I'm a very visual person. So I still need that and I love fashion. And for me that was I was lucky not to break a zipper on this carry-on luggage when I wasn't allowed to bring anything else three weeks in Hawaii. So it's going to be a challenge because I like closer art to me and I love art and  Tivity, so it's part of how I express my creativity. So I guess I am also looking forward to like, I'm curating an amazing wardrobe on the on the road as well now. Yeah.  Cool. I like that. I'm in my life. I would like to not own a lot of things. My dad owns a lot of things. However, he keeps it very neat. Yeah, which is impressive but just like I'm hoping my dream goal is my goal to have a clean garage totally clean and just put whatever I want in there this it's I can just go out there and be like, this is basically another part of my house. It's so clean Sheldon. That's my goal. Yeah flooring. Yeah mood lighting and  Well, when that happens give us a call. We'll come and celebrate with you. And yeah, I are your clean garage by Mike Lee's garage my two blankets and my my mattress that I will get 20 20 is the year of the bigger mattress. We do you own a weighted blanket if you're going to own one blanket the weighted blanket. I do not own a weighted blanket. I want one. I am hoping I'm probably going to Shell out and get a penalty blanket one of these days.  That's one of my bucket list items is a Pendleton blanket and that'll probably be it. That'll probably be the only blanket all ever need to own in my life. You're fine with a wool on your skin. I think so. I don't know. Okay, I don't know. We'll see I think people misunderstand the weighted blanket because so it's filled with these glass beads. So they're advertised a lot of them as being cooling so you could have the weight of the blanket you could be in a warm area and you know still feel you know have that cozy feeling the thing that I discovered. This is the big secret is that  If you put your weighted blanket on top of a warm quilt, it pushes the warm quilt on you and now you're twice as cozy on the warm scale. So it's it has you know, multi-purpose. I when I worked at Bed Bath and Beyond I had a customer come through purchasing a weighted blanket and I was talking to him about it. And he said well, I want to get a weighted blanket because I always fall asleep at the dentist when they put that led bib on the x-rays.  So I'm gonna get this way to Blake it to see if it works and I thought this that's actually really good line of reasoning. Yeah, because I too fell asleep at the dentist. Just laying there with my mouth curbing, huh? Yeah, so maybe we'll see I want one because I don't like in the summer.  Sleeping unlike it gets hot, you know, yes. Yeah, but I don't like sleeping without the weight of a blanket on me. Right exactly. So it's like a catch-22 in the summer because you think I waited blankets as feature. Yeah, so  Let's talk about this because this is kind of ties into your main theme for the Nomad quest which is you guys want to talk and meet all these interesting people and something that I have observed over the years of knowing you guys is that you guys have a both of you have a strong ability to get into conversations with people with strangers and very quickly cut through small talk and seemingly like develop relationships with people very quickly in life.  Get to know people's life. Like I don't know how many times I've heard Mark like offhandedly say like yeah. I met this guy and he was telling me his life story and that makes me like, how did you get this guy to just like tell you your life story? So I want to know what are your guys is tips and tricks Secrets techniques whatever for being able to quickly, you know, get to get to deeper conversations with people you just met well.  I think a smile goes a long way and I think a like in a store. Hey, you know, thanks for shopping at Ross or will you know, whatever someone will say something like that and I or they'll say hey how you doing? And then I will smile and say how are you doing and look at them and they'll go like well good. Well, thanks for asking and sometimes like a particular one. We're garage saling or I'm going to Camp Ground. I I tell them about me. I start with my story and use I find if I can.  Start with a story I have it seems like it breaks the ice that if I'm vulnerable and like I was just walking today and guy said hey, I need to be walking to and I said well, we're getting ready to sell our house and go on a we're going to go on this trip for two years and he says I'm trying to get my wife to do the same thing. And so a lot of times it's I think if you will tell your story first not everyone's going to pick you up on that. Some people are slowing the up.  Updating but there's a number of people that will immediately jump into that conversation when you've expressed from vulnerability and they'll start telling their story. Well, I think everybody's number one desire is to connect. So if you already know if you have good mental help General, I guess you could say that is that you want to connect with people. So I think people read our body language may be as like we find you fascinating, you know,  When we honestly do we think people are amazing and I think they see that so they I think they're reading our general interest in them. We love people. I was raised by a woman who loves people. I mean, I'd lose track of her. We'd be grocery shopping. I'd find her in it, you know and some other aisle and it would be the same thing, you know, somebody practically, you know, well, it wouldn't be just telling the live storage they would be crying or how can that be Cryin it and holding each other? Yeah. She's just so good. She just loved people.  All kinds of people and I come home from school there be somebody following her around while she's cleaning house just to listen to her, you know, and so that was a really and I don't know if it was nurturing nature but people are fascinating and I think they want to connect so I think that's one reason and I talk to people like I've always known them like I pretend it's like our 100th conversation. I mean because in a way we do have a ton in common many many times. So like it's funny that you mentioned like Ross because one thing that  Daughter and I do like humor to me is one thing that really connects people instantly. So what we made it a point to whenever walking into Ross together is to shout welcome to Ross at the person in charge of saying welcome to Ross we'd walk in and immediately go welcome to Ross before they could say welcome to Ross. So, you know just finding an excuse to laugh. Okay, that's Quest is an excuse to go and love people. Yeah, and the keep on someone just doesn't  Don't pick you up on the conversation. Just keep on going. Maybe the next person you run into, you know, there's a number of people that just like well that wasn't much but you'll yeah, usually any Saturday Friday garage saling I'll find somebody that I could probably have stayed in their garage for an hour and just kept talking to the yeah, we've had people stand in our garage sale for three or four hours like they came and stayed. Yeah. Yeah. We just it's people are  Fascinating and we just love love love engaging in on a deep level deep deep level. Yeah, not much room for the small talk, you know niceties ready to kind of move on from that. But yeah deep real conversation. We're vulnerable and honest and everything, but one other thing I guess I might before we move on it from this question is kind of like how you guys encourage me when I was really nervous about getting on this podcast and your advice is kind of like you need to like not be thinking about yourself.  Elf you like think about kind of it's more of think about the other person I guess. Hmm. Maybe that's not what you told me. If I think it was kind of not about being self-conscious. Yeah, you know what I mean of just be yourself and not really I guess I don't look to my interactions with strangers as a way to reinforce my value or yeah, I know that it's socially risky and so if I  Kind of have the confidence. I think it's that's what you guys were telling me about like be just, you know, feel the confidence in it. And yeah, it's all going to be. Okay. Yeah, I think also it's the let them know s ask them for help. A lot of times some will say something and I'll say like uni, give me or more information. I tell me about that or I'll be somewhere new like at a restaurant or something like that and I'm going like I'm a newbie. I have no idea how this works. People want to help other people.  Yeah, they want to help you and they kind of smile I go. Well, this is the way and or it's like okay. This is the first time I've ever been here when we are in a why I was telling people and maybe some people might say, well don't let people know you're a tourist but I was telling people constantly. This is the first time I've ever been to the islands. I'm here in my 40th wedding anniversary and typically people just jumped all over that and said, well you gotta mean in this IV done that yet people really are you give him a chance?  They do want to help you. Yeah, that's cool. That's a good that's like a very like counterintuitive thing because I feel like most people don't like to ask for help. Hmm. So but that's like a cool way to think about it. I was like give people the opportunity to talk to you. Yeah, I like helping people I do too, but I don't always like asking for help. I'm also bad at smiling. So that's the things we need to work on. That's really good 20/20 work on smiling.  To express emotions. Okay. Well, ooh, this is a good question. This is one of Adam wanted to ask I can't remember I sent this to you guys or no. I think I'm good. I asked you about it. I'm pretty sure I said this the billboard question. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is not in any way related to the no man Quest specifically, but this is a question from another guy who has a podcast and does many many interviews. The question is if you had a billboard  That everybody in the world can see what would it say?  Go ahead of me. Well, one of the things I could think that  I mean I got so many things that you know, you might say but the ones I know you handed it one you went on your 5758 Day Road Trip a couple years ago across the country the only God card the only God sticker my God Only God and I don't know maybe a billboard shouldn't say too much. Yeah, maybe a billboard should get a point across but it leaves a little bit of where a person has to think about it a little bit only God. It's like  Okay, what does that exactly fully mean and a person can go a lot of places with it and all come to some really good conclusions. Yeah. I remember having those cards we would lead that leave them. They were black and white about the size of a business card. We leave em, so we took one to leave on the steps of the Supreme Court and somebody was taking our picture. We were holding it up and somebody walked past right there on the steps and they were like, what does that mean to us it meant  That there is where the answers are. You know, it's only God can well what my explanation to him was, you know only God can fix what's going on. You know that he has all the answers. Mine is somewhat similar to something really light-hearted like virtue is the answer repent or perish it's like hardest. Yeah repent or perish are are you know, you're only going to get one bill?  bored, so yeah, you better not waste it so I mean we love to  Mark and I like to laugh a lot but when it comes to your one billboard, you just gotta say what needs to be said, I think so. There's a time to laugh and there's a time to say what needs to be said. I feel like I really there's definitely a billboard somewhere in the Bible Belt that says repent repent. Yeah. She like I was gonna say I feel like I've seen a couple of those probably  social or personal or national problem that virtue doesn't play a part in preventing and or solving it's the answer you look at the fruits of the spirit you look at you know, just The Virtuous God defines it. You know it really it's what can put us all back together nurse Mele nationally.  in the world  If we don't take a lot of stances on this podcast virtue, I'll take that stance virtue answer. Do you have another question? That's pretty well. The only thing I have left is spicy Tunes. Do you have anything else you want to talk about? There's I gotta ask mom's question. Oh, yeah. She wants to know what you're doing with your cat Bella. How are the logistics working on that? I was wondering if you guys noticed the cat box when you came in. Does anybody know? I mean how many square feet are we existing in?  That many of us right here. Not that many idea. Not many. I mean it's 24 feet long on the exterior. But the I mean, it's a very short space. Do you see the cat box Silas pointed out a reflective box? Yes. So Silas me lies. So it's underneath the desk area there. And so yeah, that's where I tried to make it where you couldn't see the cat box. Basically exactly you're just seeing mirror. So that's that but she is coming along she's coming. This is  Where her food goes on the little cup holders get in the back back by the couches. So she's coming and we found what a $10 $15 cat stroller at a garage. So that was an obnoxious pink with brown polka dots that's now been spray-painted silver. Okay, and it's covered with all kinds. I mean if people are going to look at it and go like where you from Portland and we're walking our cat. Yeah this big white  A chinchilla in Persian probably going to be shaved most of the air. But yeah, she is coming and fact she's going to have a page on the blog. So the blog Nomads you and I dot squarespace.com which right now is a blank slate but owned Bella's going to have a whole section called cats Across America. And so we're going to photograph cats Across America and Bella's going to  Right. She's going to borrow my fingers, but she's going to write the background in the stories of these cats. And I think she might have kind of a pompous attitude a little judgmental or critique or so, that'll be a little comedy section of our blog but we'll also have our podcasts. It'll have maybe marks sermons. Not sure what all we're going to load up there. But we want also want to go around and interview couples this we go visit these 100.  Churches and share encouraging stories from them. Yeah. So as we try rolling around we're going to really appreciate it place to park. We're bending this a hundred percent on our own not looking for any donations or anything like that. I mean if people wanted to give us a sack of Bibles to pass out we'd be into that we're going to pass out my book your Fresh Start that's available through one stone publishing. We're also going to distribute that because it's basically if I had  Five weeks to have a Bible class with someone what I would say, so it's 5 it's a thin book but it's five lessons that are very foundational. And so yeah, we just I guess if we're can make a request here on your podcast, it would be we need America's companionship the the Believers in America. We need your friendship. We need somebody to talk to you know, when we come and park we might need some of your electricity and maybe some of your water. Yeah to but other than that.  Activist your you know family feeling we need our we need our church family all over the country. Yeah, so let's plug first then because that's a good segue plug first like first then spicy Tunes. So where can people because we have listeners across the United States concentrated. Some of them are in other countries. That's true.  Wait, is it true? Yeah still I think so. Okay, they're less than 1% listeners across the world mostly concentrated in Oregon and the Kentucky Region. Yeah, but Kentucky's pretty Central but we know people who know people get their ties. No other people so is true if you guys have anything you want to plug is everything being centered in on Nomads dot you and I.com. Yeah. I mean, I know that I will do a  Dress that'll just basically have my photography and like travel tips. Like if other people are thinking about doing what we're doing, you know, travel tips and because you know, like I said, I've been working on this for five years. So I you know done a ton of research. So I want to make that research available available for people that are inspired by this but also shout out shout out for people that don't need anything close to this like sometimes because when something is less mmm, I guess when  When somebody is living kind of a unique lifestyle, it gets some attention, but shout out to the people that are contented to stay where they're out and trudged through and work the same job, you know decade after decade and just like the nuts and bolts of society that keep congregations tight and running and serving and I'm people like your parents. Yeah shout out to them because that's equally if not more valuable than yeah what we're about particular. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.  There's all kinds of people we need them all. So I want to be both an you know, helpful to the people that do want to do this kind of thing and also super encouraging to people that are kind of our opposites in this and be like high fives and way to go on how you're serving your congregations in that in that way. All right, so everything can be found through the coming site Nomads dot you and I.com anywhere else. They should be looking to find you Nomads dots coarse paste.  Cam I think is what it is. And then yeah Pinterest board and then I'm probably doing this is probably happening like january-march. I'll get all this up a Facebook page for Nomads you and I for now if they wanted to jump in to make sure that they're on board when they could always just friend me at Cindy Dunnigan on Facebook. Not sure if I'll do Twitter. I need to research more. Yeah. Yeah, it's all I can think of whenever things up and going we'll for sure we will post about it.  Let everyone else do I was very excited to hear that you guys were doing a podcast. Yeah said good. This is a good idea. I've been joking with my parents that I'm going to drop out of school in just go on this trip with you and your podcast is here. They don't believe pack a tent in the back. You can't see there. It's a shape of a teepee. How does that fly? That sounds great. I will gladly sleep in a teepee. Okay, two years. Okay and just go on with the cat.  A walk the cat. Oh, yeah be a value we might need a cat Walker. Yeah, you got to be ready for the combination is to do some heavy lifting. I'm willing to do some heavy lifting and willing to walk the cat. Okay. I feel like that's a pretty fair Trace. Well write your resume will give it a look. So yeah, I'm excited for the podcast to come out. Yeah, follow along so jab reward Jambi whatever Walker. Yeah, Jabberwocky listeners stay tuned for the launch of their podcast if you once  They hit the road. If you are willing to let them Park in your driveway or something like that or just hang out with them introduce him to interesting people or be an interesting person. Yeah, really anything. So one thing that they might want to be aware of is this colorful box of surprise questions. Hmm. See here. Is this is this terrifying to look at right now? No, I'm I feel like I've been very familiar with the chat pack. Okay. So this we picked out the best of the  Jetpack because you know how when you're doing these are like your we had so many different question books of insert interesting conversation starters. Yeah, you know how you'll be like, you'll pick one up, you know, now know now, you know, you're just like going to oh, here's one. Here's one. Here's what so we threw out all the nose. We kept all the cream of the crop for the chat packs and then I went through actually went through my books and kind of voice to text them into my phone so I could you know in a fast way.  Have all my baby my best questions from if we had six question books or whatever. So basically what you're looking at yeah is a box of the best conversation questions. So if you meet up with them, you will have great conversations and soon as this podcast is done. I think it'd be interesting to pull out one of these questions and you don't have to answer it but it would just be like, what question would you have? What question would we got the Russian Roulette basically socially  But instead of dying, you just talk talk. Yeah, I would say it's a good alternative. Okay. So the last thing is our spicy Tunes usually at the end of every episode we share a song that we enjoy or that we've discovered that we really like. Yeah for our listeners to enjoy as well.  And so so yeah, we have a running Spotify playlist called spicy Tunes that's been going on for like probably a year. Hmm. Maybe I think so for a while. Yeah hot minute.  Okay, so we add to this almost every episode. So if you guys have some spicy Tunes you would like to recommend those will be forever immortalized on the spicy Tunes playlist. Okay. So spicy is that that is however, you want to interpret it. It's are sometimes it's Unique songs. Uh-huh. Sometimes it's just like this is a really good song. They're like sometimes David just throws out really unique songs that like aren't super popular like Hans Zimmer's, Tennessee, but  Good song. It's a good song. But I would have never have listened to it. They're my own. There are no limitations to genre. Yeah song while we might put limitations on the song duration. Like don't recommend like a 25 minute long song but I would say recommended 20. We have some like some seven or eight we have some yeah close to 10 minute long song. Yeah. Wow, there's no limitations on genre. Are you short on certain genres? Are you looking to fill in some other think we're really short on each. I have faith that.  Genres that we are short on you probably will automatically fill in as an old person. No, well, you sent me the music that you wanted to play on the podcast and I started listening to the song and I was like, no I was like this is not what I expected and I thought and I don't know why I expected something differently because this is like went essentially what what it should be. Did it sound Nomad life to you that was  It struck me. I really liked the didgeridoo. Hmm. Okay. What is this song? What do you need this beat and a didgeridoo? Is that horse may be a sitar maybe that that might be too crazy too crazy a heart Hatter. It just seemed to have everything that we need for the background music of The Nomad Quest because it's very no Maddie, but everyone should know that course Cindy researchers everything really well that the actual no Bank Quest has a soundtracked.  That goes with is a playlist and okay. It's it's a playlist. It's a soundtrack and not only that but in the playlist and the sound lat in the soundtrack is a story or a theme. Yeah. Yeah. It's the story of The Nomad Quest from the very thought that it is very time that this little Sprout germinates in my head and then try there's a song for trying to convince Mark that it's time like the whole even before the start your engine song. There's probably eight songs.  Leading up to start your engines. Wow, there's a goodbye songs. Go by friends. I love you. There's those songs. Yeah. It's an epic epic journey is Roll With The Changes by REO Speedwagon on the playlist. This is an evolving one you play last as well. So if you know, I'll give that or I'll give that a stoat a see if it changes REO Speedwagon would be a very good addition. Well, I think when we come through Kentucky and pick up Adam for a couple weeks two cats it  I'm trouble with yeah, we will play Roll With The Changes in the air stream that has a very good sound system. Yeah, yeah.  Okay, so what songs you guys got for us?  Well, I think the song would be the quintessential that the song that we've talked about so much would be Into the Mystic and free. So Zach Brown which I mean it's sorry Zack Brown, but it's the only song that we listen to that. He does some we're not saying like listen to every because we don't know this person, but that song is I mean, it was my theme song for my 2017 only God road trip 157 days on the road we drove away.  2,300 miles that was a song that we played right when we took off and you know as there's other stories I could tell about that song but I mean just the intro just the violin in the intro is knock your socks off amazing. And so when we test-drove this Airstream, that's what I put on the Bluetooth on the stereo. Hmm free It's a combination of free and Into the Mystic. It's a love song.  Zac Brown Into the Mystic / free. I'm sure I'll find it on modify. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Yeah, that's what I like about you. That's what I like about spicy Tunes is because it's like it it every episode it like it's a little bit bigger. It's a little bit extra and we have guests on they get to add the spicy too. Yeah, that's like it's a lot of fun. That's a great idea. I love it. You're welcome. Very creative trolls not required Okay, cool. So  I think that is the episode I had a lot of fun. It was fun is good. It's not like everything. I thought it would be it's not scary at all. So thank you used to it. You really stopped caring? Yeah. Thank you for being on the podcast. Good luck on your nomad trip question. Thank you. Got to use the correct. Jargon. Thank you David for being here. Thank you. Thank you Silas in the back. Did you get a good photos of me? Probably everybody was a good photo. So we will when The Nomad Quest is on their way.  And they're going we will let everyone know where they can follow them and we will send support that way. Yep, Everybody follow the podcast follow the podcast. Well our podcast listen a spicy. Tuna. Maybe we'll come interview you guys. Yeah. Listen to spicy Tunes. Have a good day. Have a good week. Good luck on 20/20. Enjoy this decade. Enjoy this decade. Keep what do you say I said, I was going to say I hope you're doing well and your goals. Yeah day one of goals, not your resolution. Not your resolutions.  The goals of the new resolution. Yeah, we're not a fan of resolutions or goals goal-oriented. Okay. What is it? Keep on jabbering? Never hand. Peace out Girl Scouts\n"
